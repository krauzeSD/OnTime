1.- Working:
      Before writing any code, it's mandatory to write down what we want to do and how are we going to do it, 
      always in plain words, understandable for everybody.
      
      Every class, method or function must have an explanatory comment above its definition.
      

2.- Syntax:
      [] = Optional
      (input->text) = Clarifies features of elements. In this case for example the element will be an input of type text.
      N = Not (if it's the only letter then the element does not exist)
      V = Verified
      M = In Master branch
