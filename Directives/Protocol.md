# Protocol Manual

In order to correctly work with the full team, there is a need for understanding and coordination. Nonetheless, we must get 
the most ot of our time. Because of this, we have written a protocol that we must always follow. 

This protocol might be changed in the future if the team believe to do so.

## 1.- Working:
Before writing any code, it's **_mandatory_** to write down **_what_** we want to do and **_how_** are we going to do it, 
always in plain words, understandable for everybody.
      
Every class, method or function must have an **_explanatory comment_** above its definition.

## 2.- Syntax:
* (input->text) = Clarifies features of elements. In this case for example the element will be an input of type text.
* N = Not
* M = In Master branch

## 3.- Task Lists:
In the "To Do" section there are tasks lists based on what the team decides as its objetive for the next day of work. These lists must always contain a checkbox indicating if the desired work has been completed; **_in the event of an unaccomplished objetive, it is mandatory to write down the reason and circumstances behind it_**.
